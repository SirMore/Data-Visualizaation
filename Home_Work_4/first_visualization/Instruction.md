Use the provided data at the [website](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus/country/united-states?country=~USA) or All of Us data to complete the following visualization of amounts. Choose a state or region in the US and display the amounts of either hospitalizations for COVID-19 or Coronavirus infections. I am not going to assign a specific region or state or whether you choose hospitalizations or infections since I want everyone to create a unique dataviz. I will not grade you on your selection of region, but instead the quality of the dataviz.
